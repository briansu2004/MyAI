## My AI skills

1. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Include specific algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, gradient boosting, and neural networks (including deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Mention proficiency in data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA), and handling missing data.

3. **Model Evaluation and Validation**: Describe your experience in evaluating and validating machine learning models using techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and mean squared error (MSE).

4. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Highlight skills in selecting relevant features, creating new features, and performing feature engineering tasks like one-hot encoding, label encoding, and handling categorical variables.

5. **Model Deployment**: If applicable, mention experience deploying machine learning models into production environments using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving, Flask, Django, or cloud-based deployment platforms like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform.

6. **Data Science Tools**: Include proficiency with data science libraries and tools such as Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras), R, Jupyter Notebooks, and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

7. **Data Analysis**: Highlight your ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and draw insights from data using statistical methods, visualization techniques, and domain knowledge.

8. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: If relevant, mention skills in NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and building chatbots or virtual assistants.

9. **Computer Vision**: If applicable, mention experience in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and building models with frameworks like OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

## My AI projects

Machine learning, Data Science etc.

### Project 3

Built a knowledge-based ontology graph database application for a federal client

- Converted relational data model to Graph data model and imported to Neo4j.
- Used Python NLP libraries and Azure Cognitive Services APIs to analyse data, extracted entities, key phrases, and categories, then do sentiment analysis with data science algorithms in Jupyter Notebook.
- Visualized the ontology knowledge graphs with Neo4j Bloom and search phrases.

### Project 2

Built a Python AI POC for a government client to predict how much percent the issued parking tickets can be paid

- Collected the data from various sources
- Filtered out the outliers
- Split for training and testing
- Used a few algorithms and chose the best model which has the best Area Under the ROC Curve.

### Project 1

Created a Python data science POC for a large supermarket chain client

- Scraped neighborhood data from Wiki, acquired latitudes and longitudes data from the Geocoder, and retrieved location & venues data with Foursquare Places API.
- Used k-means clustering to categorize and provided the recommendations.
