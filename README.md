Machine learning, Data Science etc.

### Project 3

Built a knowledge-based ontology graph database application for a federal client

- Converted relational data model to Graph data model and imported to Neo4j.
- Used Python NLP libraries and Azure Cognitive Services APIs to analyse data, extracted entities, key phrases, and categories, then do sentiment analysis with data science algorithms in Jupyter Notebook.
- Visualized the ontology knowledge graphs with Neo4j Bloom and search phrases.

### Project 2

Built a Python AI POC for a government client to predict how much percent the issued parking tickets can be paid

- Collected the data from various sources
- Filtered out the outliers
- Split for training and testing
- Used a few algorithms and chose the best model which has the best Area Under the ROC Curve.

### Project 1

Created a Python data science POC for a large supermarket chain client

- Scraped neighborhood data from Wiki, acquired latitudes and longitudes data from the Geocoder, and retrieved location & venues data with Foursquare Places API.
- Used k-means clustering to categorize and provided the recommendations.
